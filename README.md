# RCTN-neuro-bootcamp

Why should you care?

Sparse coding is both a fundamental principle for understanding sensory processing in the brain and an important machine learning technique in its own right. 

What is in the tutorial?

The focus of this tutorial is to introduce the audience to a simple example of sparse coding. 

Sparse coding allows us to decompose handwritten digits into their generative components, which are pen strokes. Next, you will see how the properties of the cells in the human visual cortex are predicted by sparse coding of natural images. 


Installation:

After installing python, just download the repository and open the main file 'sparse_coding.ipynb' using ipython notebook. 


Uses:

Code for the RCTN section of the HWNI Neuroscience Boot Camp
Tutorial for the UCB Neuroscience Data Mining Group
