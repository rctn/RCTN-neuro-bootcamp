# RCTN-neuro-bootcamp
Code for the RCTN section of the HWNI Neuroscience Boot Camp
(Also being used as a tutorial for the UCB Neuroscience Data Mining Group)

The focus of this tutorial is to introduce the audience to a simple example of sparse coding. The punchline is that sparse coding allows us to decompose handwritten digits into their generative components, which are pen strokes. 

In order to use this tutorial, open the main file 'sparse_coding.ipynb' using ipython notebook.
